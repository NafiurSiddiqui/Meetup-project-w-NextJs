*@MyApp - ðŸ‘† this component is a special component provided by NextJ.
- if we had 1000 pages, going around wrapping those pages would have been impossible.

- wrapping this component with whatever comoponent we wanna wrap every pages with, does the trick.

- This <Component> is our actual place where the pages will be rendered whenever we navigate to other pages.
